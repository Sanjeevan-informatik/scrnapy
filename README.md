# scrnapy


single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments are a merging technique in this era. to analysis the single-cell RNA-seq there are several toolkits that are available, each tool was developed by their own company perspective to help the science communities. 

we develop our single-cell RNA-seq toolkit to solve the cut-off edge science problem to analyze the RNA-seq data proper way. the tools known as scrnapy to science community,these bioinformatic tools contain the function to link the count's matrices with single-cell and gene data, Filtering cells by library size and  remove the  lowly expressed genes from the dataset, normalization data to future analysis.finally we apply the principal component analysis, to see which cells show the similarity expression level.
